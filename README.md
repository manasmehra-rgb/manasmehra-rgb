## Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I am ... 

A Student at UMass Amherst, double majoring in Computational Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science, with a minor in Economics. Even though Iâ€™ve only been in university for two years, Iâ€™m already in my final semester (took a shit ton of extra credits) â€” *hashtag subtle flex*.


Very veRy Very Proficient in: 
* Python(numpy, pandas, scikit learn matplotlib, seaborn) 
* Sql 
* Java 

Not so Proficent but have experice working with: 
* R, C, C#, Flask, 
* Unity Game Dev (made a few games ... most prod of my [3d runner game](https://mystemmanual.blogspot.com/2022/08/3-d-unity-endless-runner-game.html) - sort of like Subway Surfers But More Aesthetic & with more Player Movement)
* Robotics & Mechatronics (most proud of... [Obstacle Avioding Car](https://mystemmanual.blogspot.com/2022/06/arduino-obstacle-avoiding-car-tutorial.html) & [Smartphone Controlled RC Car](https://mystemmanual.blogspot.com/2021/05/smartphone-controlled-rc-car.html))

Passionate about Building stuff specially hands on. I was into robotics and mechatronics quite a lot before college and documented most of my projects in a [Blog](https://mystemmanual.blogspot.com/) and a very cringe Youtube channel.

I also love to play Basketball(Varsity captain), watch Anime and Play Poker & Black Jack (Yes i occasionally gamble if you couldn't already tell)
