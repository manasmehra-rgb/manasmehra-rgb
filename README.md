Profile

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, double majoring in **Computational Mathematics** and **Statistics & Data Science**, with a minor in **Economics**.

My academic training emphasizes mathematical modeling, statistical computing, and machine learning, supported by coursework in linear algebra, probability, algorithms, scientific computing, econometrics, and applied machine learning.

This GitHub primarily contains coursework-driven and independent projects that apply these concepts to real-world datasets, including supervised learning, simulation-based modeling, regression analysis, and interactive data applications built in Python.
