Passionate about Building stuff specially hands on. I was into robotics and mechatronics quite a lot before college and documented most of my projects in a [Blog](https://mystemmanual.blogspot.com/) and a very cringe Youtube channel.

I also love to play Basketball(Varsity captain), watch Anime and Play Poker & Black Jack (Yes i occasionally gamble if you couldn't already tell)
